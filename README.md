For the user management I used Django in the backend. I implemented a role based User management so that the users can have different permissions on the UI which may be an added value. The password are also encrypted for security purpose.   For the tasks management module, the tasks are listed by user. You can only see tasks that you have created or assigned to you. And only the owner of the task can update or delete. An assignee can not update or delete a task.  You can watch this small demo to get a small overview of what I implemented.
